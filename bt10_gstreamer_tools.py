# Hey there! This is a summary of the GStreamer Tools Tutorial. â˜•
# Remember, this tutorial is about tools, not coding, so relax and enjoy!

1. **gst-launch-1.0**: Allows you to build and run GStreamer pipelines directly from the command line without writing any C code. It's primarily a debugging tool for developers and should not be used to build applications. Instead, use the `gst_parse_launch()` function of the GStreamer API for constructing pipelines from descriptions.

2. **gst-inspect-1.0**: Helps you discover available GStreamer elements and their capabilities. It's essential for understanding what plugins are installed and how to use them effectively.

3. **gst-discoverer-1.0**: Analyzes media files to reveal their internal structure, such as codecs used, duration, and other metadata. This tool is handy for debugging and understanding media content.
